### Idea
My idea/problem of choice is to focus on a particular neighbourhood in Toronto, Garden District, Ryerson.

### Resources
I will use the Foursquare location data to solve this problem. 

### Audience
My audience is any particular stakeholder that will like to use the data on Garden District, Ryerson to identify different kind of venues to solve a particular problem (social, mobility, marketing, other) within this neighbourhood. My audience would care about this problem because it's interesting and useful to have more accurata data on this neighbourhood.
